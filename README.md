## Stamped App
Fully browser-based app for taking timestamped notes

### Why?
My wife is a user researcher, and needed a simple, effective way to take timestamped notes to help her reference user research recordings during analysis. There's no server by design - notes are saved locally to your browser storage, accessible only to you.
